 Car Parking Spot Counter, a powerful solution that utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as Mediapipe and other libraries to automatically track and count the number of available parking spaces in a video or image.

With this innovative system, you can simply upload a video or image of a parking area, and our advanced algorithms will analyze the footage to determine the number of vacant parking spots. Gone are the days of manually counting parking spaces or relying on outdated methods. Our Car Parking Spot Counter provides an efficient and accurate solution.

The heart of our system lies in the integration of Mediapipe, a powerful framework for building multimodal (audio, video, and sensor) applied ML pipelines. Leveraging its robust capabilities, our solution utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and track parking spaces within the provided footage.

Here's how it works:

Video/Image Input: Users can upload a video or image containing the parking area they want to analyze. The system accepts various file formats, making it flexible and user-friendly.

Parking Space Detection: Our system employs computer vision algorithms to detect and identify parking spaces within the given footage. By analyzing key features, patterns, and shapes, the system can accurately identify individual parking spots.

Tracking and Counting: Once the parking spaces are detected, our system tracks their occupancy status throughout the video or image sequence. It distinguishes between occupied and vacant parking spots, updating the count in real-time.

Result Visualization: The system generates a visual representation of the parking area, highlighting the detected parking spaces and providing a clear indication of which spots are available and which are occupied. The final count of available parking spaces is displayed, making it easy for users to make informed decisions.

Our Car Parking Spot Counter offers numerous advantages, including:

Time and Effort Savings: The automated process eliminates the need for manual counting, saving significant time and effort for parking management personnel.

Accuracy and Reliability: Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques, our system provides reliable results, minimizing errors and ensuring accurate parking space counts.

Scalability: Our solution can be applied to various parking areas, regardless of size or layout. It is adaptable and can handle a wide range of parking lot configurations.

Real-Time Monitoring: By analyzing video footage in real-time, our system allows for continuous monitoring of parking space availability. This enables prompt actions, such as directing drivers to vacant spots and optimizing parking operations.

Our Car Parking Spot Counter represents a leap forward in parking management technology. It streamlines the process of monitoring parking space occupancy, making it more efficient, accurate, and user-friendly. Experience the power of automation and data-driven decision-making with our innovative solution, and revolutionize the way parking spaces are managed and utilized.
